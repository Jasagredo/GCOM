Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition algorithms

## First exercise: code the least squares and the LDA methods as well as a classifier method.
- [x] code the least squares algorithm.
- [x] code the LDA algorithm.
- [x] encapsulate in classes.
- [x] create graphic interface.
- [x] create buttons for methods.
- [x] create buttons for choosing classes.
- [x] change colors with classes.
- [x] connect buttons with algorithms.
- [ ] draw hyperplanes.
- [x] get background classes.
- [ ] colorize background.
- [x] dynamic recalculation.
- [ ] dynamic drawing.

- [ ] bug detected: moving a point outside the board doesn't allow releasing it unless you click again outside the board.
