## First exercise: code the least squares and the LDA methods as well as a classifier method.
- [x] code the least squares algorithm.
- [x] code the least squares classify method.
- [x] code the LDA algorithm.
- [x] code the LDA classify method.
- [x] encapsulate in classes.
- [x] create graphic interface.
- [x] create buttons for methods.
- [x] create buttons for choosing classes.
- [x] change colors with classes.
- [x] connect buttons with algorithms.
- [x] get background classes.
- [x] colorize background.
- [x] make the background grid more dense.
- [x] dynamic recalculation.
- [x] dynamic drawing.
- [x] LDA Multiclass line calculation
- [x] LDA Multiclass separating value(s)

## Second exercise: code 10 perceptron (one for each digit) and test them using the NIST database
- [ ] understand the MNIST format [referenced here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- [ ] code one perceptron for normal values
- [ ] integrate it with matplotlib
- [ ] organize the array of perceptrons for each digit
- [ ] make the perceptron analyze MNIST images
- [ ] prepare the train and test
- [ ] run the train and test
- [ ] draw on matplotlib
- [ ] create a perceptron for the transformed XOR problem
