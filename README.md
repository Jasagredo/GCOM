## Second exercise: code 10 perceptron (one for each digit) and test them using the NIST database
- [x] understand the MNIST format [referenced here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- [x] code one perceptron for normal values
- [x] integrate it with matplotlib
- [x] organize the array of perceptrons for each digit
- [x] make the perceptron analyze MNIST images
- [x] prepare the train and test
- [x] run the train and test
- [x] draw on matplotlib
- [x] create a perceptron for the transformed XOR problem
